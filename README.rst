The Amazon Braket PennyLane plugin offers four Amazon Braket quantum devices to work with PennyLane:

* ``braket.aws.qubit`` for running with the Amazon Braket service's quantum devices, both QPUs and simulators
* ``braket.local.qubit`` for running the Amazon Braket SDK's local simulator where you can optionally specify the backend ("default", "braket_sv", "braket_dm" etc)
* ``braket.aws.ahs`` for running with the Amazon Braket service's analog Hamiltonian simulation QPUs
* ``braket.local.ahs`` for running analog Hamiltonian simulation on Amazon Braket SDK's local simulator

The `Amazon Braket Python SDK <https://github.com/amazon-braket/amazon-braket-sdk-python>`__ is an open source
library that provides a framework to interact with quantum computing hardware
devices and simulators through Amazon Braket.

`PennyLane <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io>`__ is a machine learning library for optimization and automatic
differentiation of hybrid quantum-classical computations.

The plugin documentation can be found here: `<https://amazon-braket-pennylane-plugin-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.

Features
========

Provides four devices to be used with PennyLane:

* Two gate-based devices, ``braket.aws.qubit`` for running on the Amazon Braket service,
  and ``braket.local.qubit`` for running on the Amazon Braket SDK's local simulator.
* Two analog Hamiltonian simulation devices, ``braket.aws.ahs`` for running on QPU via the Amazon Braket service,
  and ``braket.local.ahs`` for running on the Amazon Braket SDK's local simulator.
* Combines Amazon Braket with PennyLane's automatic differentiation and optimization.


For the gate-based devices:

* Both devices support most core qubit PennyLane operations.
* All PennyLane observables are supported.
* Provides custom PennyLane operations to cover additional Braket operations: ``ISWAP``, ``PSWAP``, and many more.
  Every custom operation supports analytic differentiation.


For the analog Hamiltonian simulation devices:

* The devices support ``ParametrizedEvolution`` operators created via the
  `PennyLane pulse programming <https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/qml_pulse.html>`_ module.
* PennyLane observables in the measurement (Z) basis are supported
* Provides translation of user-defined pulse level control to simulation and hardware implementation

Installation
============

Before you begin working with the Amazon Braket PennyLane Plugin, make sure
that you installed or configured the following prerequisites:


* Download and install `Python 3.9 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__ or greater.
  If you are using Windows, choose the option *Add Python to environment variables* before you begin the installation.
* Make sure that your AWS account is onboarded to Amazon Braket, as per the instructions
  `here <https://github.com/amazon-braket/amazon-braket-sdk-python#prerequisites>`__.
* Download and install `PennyLane <https://pennylane.ai/install.html>`__:

  .. code-block:: bash

      pip install pennylane


You can then install the latest release of the PennyLane-Braket plugin as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install amazon-braket-pennylane-plugin


You can also install the development version from source by cloning this repository and running a
pip install command in the root directory of the repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/amazon-braket/amazon-braket-pennylane-plugin-python.git
    cd amazon-braket-pennylane-plugin-python
    pip install .


You can check your currently installed version of ``amazon-braket-pennylane-plugin`` with ``pip show``:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip show amazon-braket-pennylane-plugin


or alternatively from within Python:

.. code-block:: python

    from braket import pennylane_plugin
    pennylane_plugin.__version__

Tests
~~~~~

Make sure to install test dependencies first:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -e "amazon-braket-pennylane-plugin-python[test]"

Unit tests
**********

Run the unit tests using:

.. code-block:: bash

    tox -e unit-tests


To run an individual test:

.. code-block:: bash

    tox -e unit-tests -- -k 'your_test'


To run linters and unit tests:

.. code-block:: bash

    tox

Integration tests
*****************

To run the integration tests, set the ``AWS_PROFILE`` as explained in the amazon-braket-sdk-python
`README <https://github.com/amazon-braket/amazon-braket-sdk-python/blob/main/README.md>`__:

.. code-block:: bash

    export AWS_PROFILE=Your_Profile_Name


Running the integration tests creates an S3 bucket in the same account as the ``AWS_PROFILE``
with the following naming convention ``amazon-braket-pennylane-plugin-integ-tests-{account_id}``.

Run the integration tests with:

.. code-block:: bash

    tox -e integ-tests

To run an individual integration test:

.. code-block:: bash

    tox -e integ-tests -- -k 'your_test'

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build the HTML documentation, run:

.. code-block:: bash

  tox -e docs

The documentation can then be found in the ``doc/build/documentation/html/`` directory.
